# Bluetooth Control App
  All this app does is control an Arduino with an HC-05 module with my code on it.
 This app runs on android. The Arduino setup is a steering servo and a motor with an H-Bridge circuit I built.
It also has a button to reset the connection between the Arduino HC-05 module
and the Android app.
